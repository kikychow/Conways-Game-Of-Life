# Conway's Game of Life

My project is based on a well-known simulation – Conway's Game of Life, written in VB.NET.

Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is implemented on an infinite 2-dimensional grid of squared cells. Each cell has two possible states, either dead or alive. The state of each cell is updated in discrete time steps depending on its current state and the state of its neighbours. The four fundamental rules of the simulation as follows:

1.	Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under population.
2.	Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.	Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.	Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Different states of cells together create patterns on the grid. The simulation runs in iterations and shows the evolution of patterns.
